# Project FlyWave

The goal of the FlyWave team of UAVs@Berkeley is to develop a drone that can
maneuver autonomously using computer vision and deep learning to detect hand
gestures.

## Highlights 
- Person classification
- Hand gesture detection
- Person movement tracking (in progress)
- Gesture detection control (in progress)

## Requirements
1. Parrot Bebop 2
2. Packages: Tensorflow, Keras, OpenCV, and necessary PyParrot packages described [here](https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot/wiki/Installing-pyparrot).

## Setup
1. Connect to the Bebop's Wifi. 
2. Run:
```
python drone_tracking.py
```
